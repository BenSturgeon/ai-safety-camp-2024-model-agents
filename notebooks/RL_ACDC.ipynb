    "Original Usage: Add hooks dynamically to specific nodes or layers in the model based on certain conditions.\n",

    "7. setup_corrupted_cache (Cache Setup for Modifications)\n",
    "Original Usage: Set up a cache system to store corrupted (modified) activations.\n",

    "\n",
    "9. step (Process One Node)\n",
    "Original Usage: Processes one computational node, evaluates its impact, and decides whether to keep the current configuration.\n",
    "RL Application: Translate to processing one step or episode in RL, evaluating the agent's performance, and deciding whether to keep the modifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. remove_redundant_node (Cleanup)\n",
    "Original Usage: Remove nodes that are found to be redundant based on the experiment's criteria.\n",

    "\n",
    "11. increment_current_node (Node Navigation)\n",
    "Original Usage: Move to the next node in the computational graph.\n",
