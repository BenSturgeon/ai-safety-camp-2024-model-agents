# AI Safety Camp - Model Agents
Research on how to both identify optimization targets in model agents, and how to robustly influence agent behavior based on modifying those targets.

## Setup
Install dependencies using poetry:
```bash
poetry install
```

If poetry is not installed, you can create a virtual environment and install the dependencies manually:
```bash
python3.9 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
poetry install
```
