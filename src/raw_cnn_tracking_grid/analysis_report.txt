ENTITY TRACKING EXPERIMENT REPORT
================================================================================

CONFIGURATION:
Model: ../model_interpretable.pt
Entity tracked: Blue key (entity code 4)
Mode: Raw CNN activations

METRICS USED:
- Spatial overlap: How much activation overlaps with entity position
- Activation centroid: How far the center of activation is from entity
- Peak distance: How far the peak activation is from entity
- Equivariance: How well activation movement matches entity movement
- X/Y-position correlation: Linear relationship with coordinates

VISUALIZATION GUIDE:
1. Check '{layer}_all_channels_frame{idx}.png' files to see all channels at once
2. The red dot on each activation map shows the entity position
3. For intervention experiments, prioritize channels with high spatial overlap
   and equivariance scores, as these are most likely to represent the entity
