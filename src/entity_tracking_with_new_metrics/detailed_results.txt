ENTITY TRACKING EXPERIMENT REPORT
================================================================================

CONFIGURATION:
Entity tracked: Blue key (entity code 4)
Mode: SAE activations

METRICS USED:
- Spatial overlap (IOU): How much activation overlaps with entity position
- Equivariance: How well activation movement matches entity movement
- X/Y-position correlation: Linear relationship with coordinates
- SNR: Signal-to-noise ratio of entity region vs background
- Top-K Concentration: What proportion of highest activations are on entity
