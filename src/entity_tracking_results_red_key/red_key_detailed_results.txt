ENTITY TRACKING EXPERIMENT REPORT - RED KEY
================================================================================

CONFIGURATION:
Entity tracked: Red Key (entity code 6)
Mode: SAE activations

METRICS USED:
- Spatial overlap (IOU): How much activation overlaps with entity position
- Equivariance: How well activation movement matches entity movement
- X/Y-position correlation: Linear relationship with coordinates
- TopK Activation Ratio: Ratio of activation in entity region vs. elsewhere
- Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR): Mean activation in entity region vs. background noise
